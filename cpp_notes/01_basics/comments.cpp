#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // Single line comment ----- put // before the line you want to comment
    // int a=7;

    // This example uses a single-line comment at the end of a line of code:
    int b = 4; // single line comment at the end  of the line.

    // Multi line comments ------
    //  Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.
    //  Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by the compiler:
    return 0;
